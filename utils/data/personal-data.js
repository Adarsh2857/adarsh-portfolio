      My name is Arjun Maurya, and I am a passionate and enthusiastic programmer with a strong focus
      on problem-solving and web application development. I am a quick learner with a self-driven
      attitude, always eager to explore and master new technologies. With a core expertise in
      React, I enjoy building modern, scalable, and user-friendly applications, leveraging
      different stacks to make the web more open and impactful. My interests span across full-stack
      development, and I take pride in delivering clean, efficient, and creative solutions. I am open
      to opportunities that align with my skills and provide avenues for continuous learning and
      growth.
